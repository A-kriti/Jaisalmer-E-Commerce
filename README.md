Contribution Guideline ðŸ’»:
You may go through these guidelines and contribute accordingly:

Make sure you do not copy codes from external sources because that work will not be considered. Plagiarism is strictly not allowed.
You can only work on issues that you have been assigned to you.
If you want to contribute for an existing code, we prefer that you create an issue before making a PR and link your PR to that issue.
If you have modified/added code work, make sure that it is working fine before submitting.
Strictly use camel case in your functions and classes.
Do not update the README.md.
